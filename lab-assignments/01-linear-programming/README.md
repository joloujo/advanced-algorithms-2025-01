# Assignment 1: Linear Programming

This assignment will help you learn how to model and solve linear programming problems using Python and PuLP.

## 0. Setup

### 0.1 Sync & Branch Your Repo

Make sure that you are at the latest change in your repo by running the following commands:

```bash
$ git switch main
$ git pull
$ git pull upstream main
$ git push
```

Once you have done this, create a new branch for this assignment:

```bash
$ git switch -c assignment-01
```

If you are unfamiliar with or have questions about exactly what this is doing,
reach out to the teaching team on Discord, after class, or during office hours.

### 0.2 Assignment-Specific Prerequisites

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to acquire all the necessary libraries used in Assignment 1.

## 1. Network Flows Lab

The network flows lab assignment can be completed within `01-linear-programming.ipynb`.

## 2. Submission

Before submitting this assignment, make sure that you are on the `assignment-01` branch.

Then, `add` and `commit` your changed files. This should only contain the notebook edited in part 1. Be sure to write a reasonably clear commit message. We will be running the notebook again to check for correctness.

Once you have committed your changes, push them to origin (your fork of the course repository). If you have not already established an upstream branch, you will have to run `git push --set-upstream origin assignment-01`.

Open a pull request, making sure that the base repository is `USERNAME/advanced-algorithms-20XX-YY`. Set `olincollege/advanced-algorithms-2025-01-instructor` as reviewers; if you are unable to do this, manually add the teaching team members to your PR (aditivinod, crane919, AnmolRattanSingh, and ruchadave16).

Submit the URL of the PR in Canvas.

Once again, if you are unfamiliar with this process, or have questions about exactly what this is doing, reach out to the teaching team on Discord, after class, or during office hours.
