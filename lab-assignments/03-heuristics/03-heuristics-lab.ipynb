    "2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid where tiles containing even numbers can be moved around and merged to create larger numbers. If this does not ring a bell, it is highly recommended that you play the game at some point (enjoy the cupcake version [here](https://0x0800.github.io/2048-CUPCAKES/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the implementation has been given, ensure that you understand what a tile, a turn, a legal move, and when the game ends is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular implementation/walk through focuses on utilization of heuristic functions themselves (or strategies that are simple enough that a human player could follow them) & only looks ahead by 1 move (as opposed to adding this heuristic into another algorithm like nimimax or expectimax - which would yield better results)\n",
